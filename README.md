# dissertation_liverpool_hope_2025

## Project Overview

This repository contains my dissertation project for Liverpool Hope University, 2025.

Currently, I am remaking the system using Ada, C++, and Python. The aim is to enhance code quality, maintainability, and performance through multi-language architecture and best practices.

## Future Work and Improvements

Based on evaluation and emerging directions in aerospace autonomy, key improvements planned for this AI-Driven Autonomous Control System include:

1. **Fault Tolerance and Testing**
   - Introduce fault injection (e.g., sensor dropouts, actuator malfunctions) and expand safety escalation protocols to enable graceful degradation.

2. **Multi-Agent and Cooperative Autonomy**
   - Move from single-craft autonomy to multi-spacecraft coordination with ZeroMQ or MCP for inter-agent communication.

3. **Physics Engine Enhancements**
   - Upgrade CUDA-accelerated physics engine with Barnesâ€“Hut Approximation, hybrid Newtonian switching, and optimised GPU memory access.

4. **Memory and Learning Improvements**
   - Refine reward functions, employ domain randomisation, and strengthen transformer-based STM/IM/LTM memory integration.

5. **Firmware Migration to Ada**
   - Transition C++ middleware into safety-critical Ada firmware for stronger typing, concurrency management, and formal verification.

6. **Networking and Communication Improvements**
   - Modularise communication stacks: CCSDS packet handling via Ada, ZeroMQ IPC for firmware/AI communication.

7. **CCSDS Space Packet Protocol**
   - Expand Ada CCSDS implementation with bit-field packing, CRC validation, and binary compatibility cross-verification.

8. **Hybrid AI Brain**
   - Adopt a Captain (LLM) + Crew (technical modules) architecture to combine high-level reasoning and deterministic execution.

9. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration**
   - Use MCP to integrate LLM reasoning, technical tools, and memory layers, allowing backend flexibility.

10. **Portfolio and Presentation Enhancements**
    - Improve repository structure, add architecture diagrams, skills summary, simulation visuals, and public-friendly documentation.

### Why These Improvements Matter

- **Technical Depth**: Demonstrates expertise across AI/ML, CUDA, Ada, and aerospace networking.
- **Safety-Critical Engineering**: Highlights professional standards for reliability and verification.
- **Pragmatic AI Architecture**: Shows LLMs as orchestrators with specialised technical tools.
- **Portfolio Value**: Makes the project compelling for recruiters and research collaborators.

## Drone Architecture Feasibility

A future goal is to evaluate whether this architecture can be adapted for use in drone systems, exploring the robustness, performance, and integration challenges associated with it.

## Technologies

- **Ada**
- **C++**
- **Python**

Stay tuned for updates and progress!
